            <p>The Nintendo DS is a great little handheld device. While some title really do not make too much use of the dual screen functionality, those that do it well manage to enhance the gaming experience.

              I bought this to replace my existing DS Lite which developed an issue with one of the screens after one of the variable resistors that controls it came loose and eventually fell off.
              
              It is getting on a bit in years and has been replaced by DSi, DS3D, DS 2XL and 3XL range, but still remains enjoyable to play (especially if you have family with DS lites that can play some of the link-up games). While not getting as much use as it used to, I still go back to play some of the more exclusive titles to the platform such as the fantastic Professor Layton series of puzzlers.</p>

            <p>Replacement for earlier Nintendo DS, that I had had for many years. Met all my expectations, and I like the new black colour, and new carrying wallet. I would thoroughly recommend this product for brain training ( part of my early morning mental exercises)</p>

            <p>I really enjoy the fact that this game console can play Both the Game Boy Advanced games along with the new DS games. I bought this when my gameboy advanced sp stopped charging correctly so that I could still play my games from that era of gaming and play some newer games as well.

              I did buy this Used. So there were obviously a few things that weren't perfect. They could have at least wiped some of the dirt off of it before sending! But that was a easy wipe down to fix. I was also really surprised that it was packaged in an old shoe box..... But nothing was damaged through the post, so all is well there. The stylus won't stay in the slot for it, it just keeps sliding out. And the screen protectors were a little larger than the actual screen itself, so bubbles happen quite often and for someone who's slightly ocd about bubbles under the screen protectors it's a little annoying. These few little things (I say little because they don't have any effect on the actual playing of the system) along with the weak hinging (creaky - sounds like it could come apart if dropped at all) on the console are the reason I took a star away.
              
              These are only minor issues that come along with buying any used system. Overall the console came in pretty good condition and plays well. Good deal for the price.</p>
