            <p>I first started taking a serious foray into videography with the purchase of a G7 some 3 years ago. Whilst it is an absolutely fantastic camera, there were a few major features missing that I longed for that the GH5 provides in spades. Image stabilisation was one of them, as was the weather resistant body. So, why not the G80? For one, the improved electronic view finder was a major draw (my eyes are not what they once were), as was an all metal body, along with the rich feature-set of videography tools at my disposal, such as high frame rate recording, higher bit rates and 10-bit for better post processing. As much as I adore my G7, and was tempted by the G80, I knew there were times when 120p recording would be really useful to me, as would many of the other features the GH5 offers. In many ways, I see it as the next stage in my video production journey, where it is likely I will grow with the camera, much as I did with the G7.</p>

            <p>I use this for commercial and documentary filmmaking and photography.
              I am trained on all kinds of professional cameras, so can't speak for myself, but I have given instructional workshops for the gh5 and find that peole catch on quite quickly. It's easy and intuitive to handle and takes beautiful pictures and footage but does have a very specific look which won't work for all styles/genres and needs to be learned how to use.
              Never let's me down though.</p>

            <p>For 2020 I think this is now one of the best times to buy the GH5 especially if you are upgrading from the very likeable GH4, like myself which still has kept its resale value, after manually setting up with my original GH4 camera settings, I have found the GH5 second nature to use and now making full use of its stabilisation as well as 4.2.2 capabilities. Very satisfied</p>
