            <p>I now have three Sky Spring watches and can say that they are all great products. Each one is different and I would recommend the brand. They look good on your wrist and are definitely value for money. I will be buying Fossil watches again as they are reliable, good value and nice looking watches.</p>

            <p>First I have had some of the most expensive smartwatches in my collection. Fossil, Huawei, Asus, Pebble and more. I started buying some of these from China recently on Amazon and Ebay. I haven't found one that can reply to your emails or texts yet. Some I sent back to Amazon because their notifications were very poor , their vibrations were very weak and some had other failures and then I purchased this watch. This watch has fantastic battery life, has few watch faces, it receives your full texts and with emails such as yahoo and Gmail it will display the senders name and enough message so you can tell what it is about. This is more than many of these type of watches display. It displays very accurate weather temperatures and tomorrows forecast. It has accurate Step counting, Heart rates, Blood Oxygen levels, Sleep monitoring and Music Controls. Blood Pressure not so much. I have never found a watch with an accurate blood pressure reading. It is water proof to 3ft of water for swimming only.
              The screen is large and fills the watch face in a circular shape. The apps work good, and the watch face options are incredible.
              I am very impressed with this watch. It is the best watch I have found</p>

            <p>This is a nice looking stylish watch. No bells and whistles, just a basic standard watch (with a stopwatch on it). It's made well and fits really well too. I love the colour of it and the look too. It comes with a link removing tool which is a bonus. Sometimes it's nice to wear a watch that is just a watch. Very happy with it.</p>
