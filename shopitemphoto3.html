            <p> I bought this lens to go with my Canon 100D and all I can say is that for the money it is phenomenal, the different perspective you get from close up at 10mm gives your image depth and provides emphasis for your foreground subject. That being said, this lens is not perfect, at 10mm and F4.5 there is some notable vignetting, chromatic aberrations and softness in the corners but as you stop down this goes away and the lens is much sharper. The minimum aperture of F4.5 at 10mm isn't particularly wide so this lens doesn't let in a huge amount of light meaning you need a longer shutter speed or higher ISO neither of which are particularly desirable. It has an internal focus which doesn't rotate the end of the lens so it is good for using a polariser and the focus ring is very smooth to turn. This lens is great for video makers with an STM autofocus motor meaning it is nearly silent so it doesn't spoil your audio, the lens also comes with 4 stops of image stabilisation which while not necessary on such a wide angle lens is certainly nice to have and found myself using it when shooting in darker conditions with the comparatively small aperture. This lens handles flaring fairly well but a lens hood wouldn't go amiss, you can pick them up fairly cheaply on Amazon. The build quality of the lens is ok, it is an all plastic lens but still feels fairly solid and is certainly sturdier than the kit lens. Overall I am very happy with this lens and the accompanying images were all taken on this lens with the Canon 100D. </p>

            <p>I bought this Canon 9519B005AA EF-S 10-18mm f/4.5-5.6 IS STM Lens for use on my Canon 700D camera. It is a really well constructed solid lens and the image quality it produces is exceptional.

              This is the first wide angle lens I have owned and I am absolutely delighted with the results I get from this lens. So much so, that this has now become my default go to lens for landscape photography - it is rarely off my camera. I am suprised at the close focal length and how near you need to get to foreground interest when photographing - but this is something I have quickly adjusted to.
              
              The lens ha a 67mm thread for filters.</p>

            <p>I was looking for something with a wider field of view than the 18-55mm kit lens that has migrated from my old EOS 350D to my EOS 60D, in reality I was looking for something like a 6 - 8mm Fisheye but I saw this discounted here and with the Canon cash back offer I gave it a go.

              I've had the lens for about a year now and it has become pretty much my favourite lens for Landscape and close up photography, it may not be as mechanically fast as the more expensive USM version but the wide field of view and depth of field pretty much eliminate this for all but the fastest moving objects and you'd have to be dangerously close to the action for this be significant. At the low end of the scale although there is obviously some aspheric distortion it is not as significant as a full fisheye and is reasonably easy to correct in Lightroom / Photoshop. It makes for some dramatic landscapes and is pretty handy when walking around museums and exhibitions (where cameras are allowed). Overall build quality is good despite being at the budget end of Canon's range, this is a good thing because lenses stay long after camera bodies have been swapped as the content of my camera bag can attest. I'm not sure how useful the IS function actually is but I have managed to take some fairly clear, blur free shots in some low light conditions without winding up the camera ISO so I guess it's pretty effective. I take most landscape shots from a tripod so it's turned off for these anyway.</p>
