            <p>Bought as a gift for my son. It works exactly as advertised, with all the games on board instead of the old box full of cartridges. He and his sister were playing together just as they did 20+ years ago when they were children.</p>

            <p>Ahhh, the 90's. Oasis, raving all weekend and playing on my trusted Super Nintendo. What a glorious time to be alive!

              There was always that perennial school playground argument, Megadrive or SNES but that was never really a contest was it? What a machine! And now we have it as a lovely little version (im talking the UK/ EU version here, not that purple monstrosity from the US) with the original sized controllers. Games are brilliant although there were so many great titles released for the machine, people are bound to be disappointed at the ones which didn't make the cut.
              
              Personally aside from Zelda, Mario World, Mario Cart etc, the one game that sticks with me the most is Castlevania 4. Wow, having not played that game in about 25 years, it almost brought a tear to my eye, what a wonderful nostalgia trip!</p>

            <p>ou've got to love a bit of nostalgia, and with this mini snes you will reminisce over and over, funny what a few games does to yourself!
              Delivery was super fast even though I was expecting it 3 days later fab! Now if you don't mind Mario awaits.
              I forgot to say, the controllers unlike the brand (in pic) are remarkable the same (weight wise) good build!
              Only thing that slightly weighs me down a bit is having to remove the front part of the (what looks like the orriginal control socket) on the console, but all games are just how you remember them, I'm 40 in March and had the orriginal ;-)</p>
