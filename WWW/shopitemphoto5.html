The Three-Dimensional Colour Control with rich colours from dark to bright shades and high-precision Multi Process NR makes your images stand out.
              It’s difficult to handhold a camera at the best of times but thanks to the 5-axis Dual image Stabiliser 2 Intelligent compensation comes to your aid. The LUMIX GH5 eliminates shakes in both body and lens from wide-angle to tele-end.</p>

            <p>Amazing Camera for videos with pro features like 4k 60, 10bit 422, 400mbs all intra etc etc... this thing is an absolute beast and so incredibly easy to use. To me this camera is NEARLY perfect but has some bad flaws that prevent it from hitting perfection. For one, it is terrible in low light as you would expect from a M4/3 sensor. Anything beyond 1600 ISO absolutely requires a denoiser plugin like Neatvideo to make the video usable. Even at 1600 ISO, though usable, still needs a denoiser. With the GH5 being bad at low light, means it is absolutely necessary to buy fast lenses like an F1.8 or faster and Micro 4/3 lenses are not cheap.

            <p>If you are considering spending this much money on the camera, you know all about it Simply a stunning camera. It’s closest competitor is the much cheaper black magic cinema pocket camera, also a fantastic bit of kit, but this feels so rugged and stable in your hand. The build quality is amazing, but the end result is even better I’ve used the predecessor GH4 for national news reports. This is a welcome step up</p>

            <p>It's a great camera and like many others I bought it for video, not stills.
              It came with the 12-60mm lens which works well with the GH5, built in stabilization etc but it's not great for video.
              
              The lack of a fixed aperture always puts me off and i don't like lenses with a focus ring that can spin continuously.
              For photography i assume it's great but that's not my thing.
              
              The GH5 has a great feet to it, it's easy to understand and transition from other cameras to it. There's lots of info online about it and it can be set up in a minute.
              
              The footage is excellent, I don't shoot 4K but it shoots 4k very well.
              The 1080 is sharp and detailed.</p>
