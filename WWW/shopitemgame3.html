            <p>Having been an avid console and PC gamer for years, I decided I'd quit with spending hundreds every time a new console came out or to upgrade my PC by getting a console I really enjoyed. I had some initial fears that it wouldn't be able to live up to the hype of nostalgia, but it just does. I don't know why anyone ever bothered making anything after it.

              I bought a used for a pretty good price, along with a decent 3rd party controller and an unofficial AV cable. Alongside games, extra controllers and such, I've spent about £150 for almost every game I'd want, with plans to get others in the next few years.</p>

            <p>iv had a look at all the other reviews about this console but i really am looking forward to getting this console. i want to get so when i go on a car journey to devon i am then able to play the gamecube in the car on the way there because of the battery packs that you are able to buy.

              i feel that this console is very underated and it shouldn't of stopped making games for the gamecube because it looks like a great console. the controllers are very comfterble to hold meaning that you dont start to get blisters on your hand when you want to play the console for a long period of time.
              
              some people are really picky but this is a legendary console which i will probably play more than my ps3 lol
              
              i would highly recomend getting this console.</p>

            <p>I was requested by my 15 year old son to buy the purple gamecube....please Mum!
              Bought it...wasn't too expensive and the postage and packaging were ok too!...Phew!
              It arrived duly after a few days and given to 15 year old....Thanks Mum!
              Not a word since...so gather from the silence that it a) works...b) is doing what its supposed to do! Happy Mum!</p>
