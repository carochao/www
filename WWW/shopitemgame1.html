            <p>This is it, the one that started all. Think of this as the equivalent of a Walkman, it is a device that changed the way people can use a gaming console, and take their games everywhere. As a testament of how the mentality of Nintendo (as Japanese manufacturers) envisioned a durable and child-proof product, this Gameboy still works perfectly fine, despite of the years that have passed. This particular one includes original packaging brochures and manuals, and all of them in perfect conditions. The Gameboy is a landmark, THE portable gaming device that in its day was the most ambicious and state-of-the-art gizmo ever made, and its impact was not only in the gaming industry, as this gadget also uses technology that later on was incorporated in cellphones and other portable systems. The game cartridges allowed to vary the games you could play (being the previous games LCD single ones as the games manufactured by Nintendo like the Game & Watch consoles), and be able later on to play them in the Gameboy Color.
              Bottom line, the Gameboy may be old, but its entertaining capabilities are intact. Old-school games have gaming dynamics completely different from those you can play today, but its charm and nostalgia cannot be compared. Simple, yet challenging mechanics, and monochrome but awesome graphics, wrapped in a grey brick that may outlast your fancy Iphone, is a offer you cannot refuse.</p>

            <p>I bought the original Game Boy to play my old Game Boy games, and although there are newer systems out there that can do the job better like the Game Boy Advance SP with backlit screens and recharge capabilities, nothing quite compares to using this classic console.

              There is a wide range of surprisingly high quality games for the console, including Mario games, Zelda games, Pokemon Red, and of course the Game Boy classic, Tetris. The games, like the console itself are very cheap to buy now in most places.
              
              Although the console requires four AA batteries to run, a decent set of Batteries can last up to 15 hours. If this still isn't good enough for you, there are recharge packs available to fit the Game Boy, or you can buy a Game Boy adapter and play using power from the mains.
              
              The consoles biggest flaw is probably the lack of a back-light, but the screen can be clearly seen in daylight, and in the light of a lamp.
              
              Despite it's limitations, it is brilliant fun to play and if you've even considered buying one for a second, i'd recommend you buy one.</p>
